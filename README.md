# Yelp GenAI POC

The POC is designed for **local, lightweight experimentation** It progressively explores three GenAI patterns:  

1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** â†’ grounding answers in Yelp reviews.  
2. **MCP (Multi-Context Prompting)** â†’ enriching responses with metadata (e.g., sentiment, categories).  
3. **Agentic AI** â†’ enabling tool-using AI agents to query structured + unstructured data.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals
- Practice core GenAI techniques on real-world dataset.  
- Understand differences between **RAG, MCP, and Agentic AI**.  
- Build a working demo to query Yelp insights locally.  
- Gain hands-on skills in embeddings, vector databases, and orchestration.
